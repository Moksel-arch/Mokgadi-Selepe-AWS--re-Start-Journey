**Using Amazon Inspector for Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation**

**Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of Amazon Inspector to automate security assessments within an AWS environment. The primary focus is on scanning AWS Lambda functions to identify software vulnerabilities and remediate them effectively.
In this scenario, "AnyCompany" developers are building a serverless application and require an automated tool to scan both software packages and code for security flaws. Amazon Inspector was selected to meet this requirement by providing continuous scanning for Lambda functions, EC2 instances, and Amazon ECR repositories.

**Objectives**
The main goals of this lab were to:
•	Activate Amazon Inspector in the AWS Management Console.
•	Analyze and interpret vulnerability reports generated by Inspector.
•	Remediate identified security issues by patching vulnerable software packages.

**Architecture & Services Used**
•	AWS Lambda: Serverless compute service hosting the application logic.
•	Amazon Inspector: Automated vulnerability management service.
•	AWS Management Console: Interface for resource configuration and monitoring.
•	Python Runtime: The environment used for the Lambda functions.

**Workflow**
1. Activate Amazon Inspector
•	Navigated to the Amazon Inspector service in the AWS Console.
•	Activated the service for the account.
•	Verified that Inspector successfully detected the environment's resources, achieving 100% coverage for the existing Lambda functions.

3. Vulnerability Scanning & Analysis
•	Amazon Inspector automatically initiated a scan upon activation.
•	Findings: The scan detected "Medium" severity vulnerabilities within the Lambda functions.
•	Specific Finding: CVE-2023-32681 related to the Requests HTTP library.
o	Issue: The specific version of the library (requests==2.20.0) was leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint.
o	Analysis: Used the National Vulnerability Database (NIST) link provided in the Inspector console to understand the impact of the vulnerability.

5. Remediation
•	Located the vulnerable Lambda function (get-request) in the AWS Console.
•	Opened the Code Source editor.
•	Identified the dependency file requirements.txt.
•	Fix Implemented:
o	Removed the strict version pinning (requests==2.20.0).
o	Updated the line to requests to allow AWS Lambda to pull the latest, patched version of the library.
•	Deployed the updated function.

7. Verification
•	Upon deployment, Amazon Inspector automatically triggered a re-scan of the modified function.
•	Filtered the findings dashboard to show "Closed" findings.
•	Confirmed that CVE-2023-32681 was successfully resolved and the finding status changed to Closed.

**Results**
•	Successfully automated vulnerability scanning for serverless resources.
•	Identified and patched a real-world CVE in a Python dependency.
•	Validated the remediation through Inspector's continuous monitoring capabilities.
