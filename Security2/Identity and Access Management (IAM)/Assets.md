**Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

I just read the intro to the IAM lab, and here’s what it says:

- In most workplaces a single login gives you access to everything – files, printers, intranet sites, etc.
- If those permissions aren’t set up carefully, someone who shouldn’t have access can easily get in.
- This lab will show how AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) lets you control who can use which AWS resources, using users, groups, and policies.

So, the lab is going to walk through the basics of IAM: creating users, putting them into groups, and attaching policies that define what each person can do.


Here is diagram of the current environment with the listed IAM users and IAM groups.
