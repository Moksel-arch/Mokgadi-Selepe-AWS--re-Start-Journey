# **Python Programming**

## About This Lab
This lab was about understanding the difference between automation and orchestration in software development.  
Both are related but work at different levels:
- **Automation** focuses on doing single tasks without human help.
- **Orchestration** combines multiple automated tasks into a bigger workflow.

## What I Learned
- Automation makes one task run automatically (e.g., running a Python script to configure a server).
- Orchestration manages and connects many automated tasks so they work together (e.g., deploying an application stack across multiple servers).
- Both save time, reduce errors, and improve consistency.

| Goal          | Speed and consistency for tasks     | End-to-end process coordination               |
| Tools         | Bash, Python scripts, Ansible       | Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins pipelines      |

## Why It Matters
- Automation saves time and reduces errors for repetitive tasks.
- Orchestration ensures smooth coordination of complex processes.
- Together, they make DevOps faster, more reliable, and scalable.
