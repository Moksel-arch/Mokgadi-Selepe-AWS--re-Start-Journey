# **Explore the Value of Automation**

About This Project

This project is about learning automation in software development. It was part of a lab exercise where I explored how automation helps in building, testing, and deploying software.
The goal was to:
•	Research different types of automation.
•	Share findings in a short presentation.
•	Discuss the value of automation and why not everything should be automated.

***Topics Covered*

1. Build Automation
   
### Build Automation
- **What is it?**  
  Automatically compiles code after changes are made.
- **Tools:**  
  Maven, Gradle, Jenkins, Apache Ant.
- **Benefits:**  
  Saves time, ensures consistent builds, speeds up development.
- **Challenges:**  
  Setup can be complex, needs proper configuration, dependency issues.
- **Real-world Example:**  
  Jenkins used in a CI/CD pipeline for a Java application to automate builds after every commit.
- **Diagram:**  
  Jenkins pipeline showing developer commits → Jenkins builds → artifact stored.

2. Test Automation
   
### Test Automation
- **What is it?**  
  Uses scripts and tools to test software automatically after changes.
- **Tools:**  
  Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Cypress.
- **Benefits:**  
  Faster than manual testing, reduces human error, supports continuous integration.
- **Challenges:**  
  High setup cost, maintaining scripts takes time, not all tests can be automated.
- **Real-world Example:**  
  Selenium used for automated web testing in an e-commerce site to validate shopping cart functionality.
- **Diagram:**  
  Selenium workflow showing test scripts → browser automation → results.

3. Deployment Automation
   
### Deployment Automation
- **What is it?**  
  Automates moving code to a usable format for testing or production.
- **Tools:**  
  Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Benefits:**  
  Reduces deployment errors, speeds up releases, makes rollback easier.
- **Challenges:**  
  Needs skilled people, complex for large systems, security risks if misconfigured.
- **Real-world Example:**  
  Docker and Kubernetes used to deploy microservices in production for a cloud-based application.
- **Diagram:**  
  Docker & Kubernetes deployment showing containers → pods → cluster.

***Key Takeaways*

### Key Takeaways
- **Value of Automation:**  
  Saves time, reduces errors, improves consistency, and speeds up delivery.
- **Why not automate everything?**  
  Some tasks need human judgment, automation can be expensive, and over-automation can lead to unnecessary maintenance.
