# **Creating a Hello, World Program**

***Overview*

I’m starting the Introduction to Programming lab, and the whole thing is built around Python. The goal is simple: write my very first Python program

#### Creating my first Python file in Cloud9
- I opened AWS Cloud9 (it’s like an online coding laptop).
- From the top menu I clicked **File > New From Template > Python File**.
- It gave me a new empty file with some example code.
- I deleted everything inside.
- Then I clicked **File > Save As…** and named it **hello-world.py**.
- I saved it in the folder: `/home/ec2-user/environment`  
  (The “.py” at the end tells everyone it’s a Python file).

#### Opening the terminal inside Cloud9
- At the bottom I clicked the **+** button and chose **New Terminal**.
- A black command box opened (this is where we talk to the computer).
- I typed `pwd` and pressed Enter → it showed me I’m in `/home/ec2-user/environment`.
- My hello-world.py file is right there!

#### Checking which Python versions are on the computer
- I typed these commands one by one:
