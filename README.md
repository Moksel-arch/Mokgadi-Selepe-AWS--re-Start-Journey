# *Mokgadi Selepe – About Me*

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

## AWS re/Start Journey

I started the *AWS re/Start Cloud Computing Programme* on *06 October 2025* and I will finish on *26 December 2025*.  
Every day I learn something new about the cloud and I am enjoying the journey a lot.  
My big goal is to know more about this Cloud journey and later become a *Solutions Architect*.

Right now I am busy with hands-on labs in:

*   Cloud Foundations
*   Linux basics
*   Networking
*   Security & IAM
*   Python programming
*   Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)
*   Servers and compute (EC2, Lambda)
*   AWS Architecture
*   Systems Operations
*   Tooling and Automation
*   Servers
*   Scaling and Name Resolution
*   Serverless and Containers
*   AWS Database Services
*   AWS Networking Services
*   Storage and Archiving
*   Monitoring and Security
*   Managing Resource Consumption
*   Automated and Repeatable Deployments
*   AWS Machine Learning and Generative AI

**Achievement Unlocked: AWS Cloud Quest Badge**  
I am proud to have earned the AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner Trained badge!  
This badge represents my hands-on experience in building cloud solutions and understanding AWS fundamentals.

## *About This Repository*

This repository contains my learning journey and projects from the AWS re/Start program.  
It includes practical exercises and labs covering *cloud foundations, Linux, networking, security, IAM, Python programming, databases, compute services (EC2, Lambda), serverless, containers, automation, monitoring, scaling, and even machine learning with generative AI*.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in AWS and cloud computing while applying best practices for *security, scalability, and cost optimization*.  
If you are also learning AWS or exploring cloud careers, you’ll find examples and notes here that can help you understand real-world cloud architecture.

## Why Cloud Computing Excites Me

Cloud computing is transforming the way businesses and individuals build, deploy, and scale applications. What fascinates me most is how the cloud brings *flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency* to technology solutions. With services like *AWS*, you can launch servers in minutes, store data securely, and integrate advanced tools like AI and machine learning—all without managing physical infrastructure.

For me, the cloud represents *innovation and opportunity. It’s not just about hosting applications; it’s about enabling creativity, solving real-world problems, and making technology accessible to everyone. My goal is to master these concepts and eventually become an **AWS Solutions Architect* one day, helping organizations design secure, reliable, and scalable systems.
