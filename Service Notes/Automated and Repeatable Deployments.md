# **Automated and Repeatable Deployments**

## Service Note

This repository contains my lab work with AWS CloudFormation.  
It shows how I practiced creating, updating, and deleting resources using templates.

### Purpose
- Learn how CloudFormation templates work.
- Understand how Parameters, Resources, and Outputs are used.
- Practice updating stacks with new resources.
- See how deleting a stack removes everything it created.

### What I Did
- **Created a stack** with a VPC and Security Group using `task1.yaml`.
- **Added an S3 bucket** by editing the template and updating the stack.
- **Added an EC2 instance** with parameters for AMI, security group, subnet, and tags.
- **Deleted the stack** to confirm all resources were removed automatically.

### Key Notes
- YAML formatting is strict — indentation matters.
- Updating a stack only changes what’s new or modified; existing resources stay the same.
- Outputs make it easy to find important IDs or values.
- CloudFormation manages the order of resource creation for you.
