# **Mokgadi Selepe – My Certifications So Far!**

I’m Mokgadi, a South African girl who decided in 2025 that cloud is my future.  
This repo is just a simple place where I keep all my certificates and badges in one spot (so I can feel proud when I look at them).

### What I’m Busy With Right Now
I’m doing the **AWS re/Start program** full-time (06 October 2025 – 26 December 2025).  
As soon as we finish I’m writing the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam early 2026 – I’m studying hard every day!

More certificates coming soon in 2026 and beyond

I’m in the middle of the Cohort and couple of weeks to go write the AWS Cloud compute exam, but every certificate feels like proof that I’m moving forward.  
Thank you to everyone who supports me on this journey!
