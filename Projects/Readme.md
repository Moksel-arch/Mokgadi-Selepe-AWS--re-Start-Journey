## Project 1: Moving a Traditional South African Restaurant Online (@MALLS)

**Context:** Group Project: Static Website on S3

### Overview
For this project, our team of five built a modern, low-cost online presence for a fictional, yet realistic, South African restaurant called @MALLS.

### The Problem
Even in 2025, many small traditional restaurants struggle with manual processes. We addressed common issues such as:
* Reliance on paper bookings.
* Taking orders via WhatsApp.
* Lack of a centralized customer database.

### The Solution
We moved the restaurant operations online to improve efficiency and customer experience.
* **Hosting:** We used AWS S3 to host a static website.
* **Functionality:** We integrated serverless services to handle dynamic parts of the site.
* **Design:** The site features a "Proudly South African" theme, utilizing orange colors and local design elements.

**Live Site:**[Our group static website](https://static-website-on-s3.netlify.app)

### The Team
We collaborated to deliver this solution, with each member focusing on a specific area:

* **Mokgadi M.** – Web Development
* **Skhumbuzo S.** – Web Development
* **Aytee A.** – Research & Documentation
* **Lethabo L.** – AWS S3 Deployment + Infrastructure
* **Leah L.** – Presentation & Design
