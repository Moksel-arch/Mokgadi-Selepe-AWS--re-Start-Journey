# **Mokgadi-Selepe-AWS--re-Start-Journey**

Hi there!  
My name is Mokgadi and this is my little corner on GitHub where I’m keeping everything from my **AWS re/Start** journey.

I started the program on **06 October 2025** and we finish on **26 December 2025**. Time is moving so fast! After that I’m planning to write the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** exam early 2026 – I’m nervous but also super excited..

### Labs I’ve Completed So Far
I’m putting everything I learn here, one folder at a time:

- Cloud Foundations  
- Linux  
- Networking  
- Security  
- Python Programming  
- Databases   
- Servers   

Every day I finish a lab I feel like I understand the cloud a little bit more. From basic Linux commands to building databases on RDS and Aurora – it’s a lot, but I’m loving it!

**NB!!** I will keep updating this folder everytime I add some more information.

### What’s Next?
I Keep pushing until 26 December, practing hard to pass this exam.I still have so much to learn but I’m enjoying every single day.

If you’re also doing AWS re/Start or just starting with cloud – let’s connect and motivate each other!
