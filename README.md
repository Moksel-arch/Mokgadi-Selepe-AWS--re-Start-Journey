# **AWS re/Start Journey – My Cloud Learning Path (2025)**

This is Mokgadi’s little corner of GitHub where I’m keeping everything from my AWS re/Start programme. Labs, notes, screenshots, half-working code, tears, and triumphs – it’s all here.

I’m still very much in the middle of the training (started 06th October this year 2025 finishing off 26th December 2025), so this README is a work-in-progress. I’ll come back and polish it properly once I’m done with the whole course and hopefully holding that Cloud Practitioner certificate in my hand!

## Quick About Me
Mokgadi here  
AWS re/Start learner | South African | Future cloud engineer (manifesting) | Powered by strong coffee and late night sleeps.

## What’s Inside This Repo (so far)
Everything we’ve covered up to November 2025:

- Cloud Foundations
- Linux basics (yes, I can vim now… kinda)
- Networking & Security
- Python Programming
- Databases (RDS + DynamoDB = love)
- AWS Architecture
- Systems Operations + Tooling and Automation
- Servers → Serverless → Containers
- Scaling, Name Resolution, Storage, Monitoring
- Automated Deployments (SAM, CodePipeline, etc.)
- A tiny bit of Machine Learning & Generative AI

## Favourite Thing I’ve Built So Far
The @MALLS restaurant project (group of 5) – we took a real-life South African restaurant that was running on WhatsApp and paper and moved them to a fully serverless AWS setup for ~R600/month instead of R6 000+.  
Static site on S3 + CloudFront, forms → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB, Cognito login, loyalty points, interactive map… the whole thing.  
Still makes me smile every time I think about it.

## Current Status – 21 November 2025
Still grinding!  
A few more weeks of classes, final projects, exam prep, and then graduation at the end of this October Cohort with Praesignis.  
This README (and the repo) will get a proper glow-up once I’m officially done – promise.

For now, feel free to browse, laugh at my beginner mistakes, steal any code that actually works, or just say hi if you’re on the same re/Start journey.

See you on the other side of 2025! 

Still in training… will properly finish this README when I graduate end of 2025!
