# **Mokgadi-Selepe-AWS--re-Start-Journey**

Hi there!  
My name is Mokgadi and this is my little corner on GitHub where I’m keeping everything from my **AWS re/Start** journey.

I started the program on **06 October 2025** and we finish on **26 December 2025**. Time is moving so fast! After that I’m planning to write the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** exam early 2026 – I’m nervous but also super excited 😅

### Labs I’ve Completed So Far
I’m putting everything I learn here, one folder at a time:

- Cloud Foundations  
- Linux  
- Networking  
- Security  
- Python Programming  
- Databases  
- AWS Architecture  
- Systems Operations  
- Tooling and Automation  
- Servers  
- Scaling and Name Resolution  
- Serverless and Containers  
- AWS Database Services  
- AWS Networking Services  

Every day I finish a lab I feel like I understand the cloud a little bit more. From basic Linux commands to building databases on RDS and Aurora – it’s a lot, but I’m loving it!

### The Project That Made Everything Click – @MALLS Restaurant

This was our first big group project and honestly the thing I’m most proud of so far!  
We helped a real South African restaurant called **@MALLS – “Africa’s finest roots”** move from paper bookings and WhatsApp chaos to a proper modern website running 100% on AWS.

Before: double bookings, wrong orders, customers waiting, no loyalty system… pure stress!  
After: everything is online, super fast, safe, and it only costs them **R540–R630 per month** (they were losing over R6 000 a month before just because of mistakes!).

What we built:
- Static website hosted on S3  
- CloudFront for lightning-fast loading  
- Custom domain with Route 53 + free SSL  
- Booking & takeaway forms → API Gateway + Lambda  
- All data saved in DynamoDB  
- Login system with Cognito  
- Interactive map with Amazon Location Service  

Seeing the owner smile when she saw the cost drop and the website working on her phone… that feeling is why I love this cloud stuff ️

#### My Amazing Team (I love these people!)
- **Me (Mokgadi)** → Web Developer (HTML, CSS, some Lambda functions)  
- **Skhumbuzo** → Web Developer (his JavaScript is magic!)  
- **Lethabo** → Deployed everything to S3 and made it actually work  
- **Aytee** → Researcher & Documenter (our notes were perfect because of her)  
- **Leah** → Presenter (she made us look so professional on presentation day)

You can find our full presentation in the repo → **Presentation for @MALLS.pdf**  
There are also lots of screenshots of the real website we launched.

### What’s Next?
I Keep pushing until 26 December, practing hard to pass this exam.I still have so much to learn but I’m enjoying every single day.

If you’re also doing AWS re/Start or just starting with cloud – let’s connect and motivate each other!
