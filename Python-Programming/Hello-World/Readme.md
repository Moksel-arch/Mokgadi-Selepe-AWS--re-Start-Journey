# **Python Programming – Hello, World! (Take Two)**

***Welcome to my GitHub repo!*

Yes, this is literally a “Hello, World!” program… but hear me out.

I’ve actually been writing Python for months now — built machine learning models, cleaned messy Airbnb datasets, wrestled with NumPy/Pandas for hours, and even deployed a few things to production during my data science bootcamp. I thought I was past the beginner stage.

Then my new “Introduction to Programming” course made me start from absolute scratch again, and honestly? I’m kinda loving it.

There’s something ridiculously satisfying about going back to the basics after you’ve already fought with real-world data. It’s like returning to the gym after a long break and suddenly being able to lift the warm-up weights with perfect form.

## The Star of the Show: hello-world.py

```python
# hello-world.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

Still only one line. Still makes me smile.

## Why this repo exists

1. The course requires proof I did the lab (screenshots + code).
2. I secretly enjoy the nostalgia of seeing how far I’ve come.
3. Future me will probably laugh at this when I’m debugging some monstrous pipeline at 3 a.m.

## Quick flashback to “advanced” me (for context)

- Predicted Cape Town Airbnb prices with Random Forest
- Cleaned years of weather and energy data with Pandas
- Built dashboards, trained models, pushed to Git… the whole data science thing

And yet here I am, proudly committing a single print statement like it’s my first rodeo.

## How I ran it this time

Same AWS Cloud9 setup as always:
```bash
python3 hello-world.py
→ Hello, World!
```

Mission accomplished.

## What’s next in this course?

- Variables, loops, conditionals (stuff I use daily but now have to explain like I’ve never seen them before)
- Functions, lists, dictionaries… again
- Eventually building tiny projects from scratch

If you’re just starting Python — you’ve got this.  
If you’re like me and already deep into data science / ML — come hang out anyway. Sometimes the simplest things are the most fun to revisit.

Stick around. I’ll keep pushing every lab as I go.
