# **AWS SimuLearn: Create an AI Smart Assistant**

I read the lab goals, hit “Start Lab” (or opened the AWS Console), followed the step‑by‑step instructions using the navigation arrows, and noted that unused AWS services are disabled and the used ones are limited to the lab’s needs.

I went back to the Amazon S3 console, opened the General purpose buckets tab, and clicked the bucket whose name starts with knowledge-base-bucket-. Then I moved on to the next step.

I opened the Objects tab and saw the list of files—​employee_handbook.txt (used in the current Practice section) and compensation_handbook.txt (used later in the DIY section). I could click either file to review its contents, then I moved on to the next step.
