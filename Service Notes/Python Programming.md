# **Service Note – Python Programming Lab**

```markdown

## Purpose
This note explains the main goal of my Python Programming lab.  
The lab focused on understanding the difference between **automation** and **orchestration** in software development.

## Objectives
- Learn how automation handles single tasks without human help.
- Learn how orchestration connects multiple automated tasks into workflows.
- Compare tools and examples used in both approaches.
- Practice categorizing keywords into automation, orchestration, or both.

## Summary of Work
- Studied examples like Python scripts (automation) and Terraform/Kubernetes (orchestration).
- Built keyword categorization tables to show how concepts fit into each category.
- Compared automation vs orchestration by scope, goals, and tools.
- Reflected on why both matter in DevOps for saving time, reducing errors, and improving consistency.

## Key Notes
- Automation = single task, speed, consistency.
- Orchestration = multiple tasks, coordination, workflows.
- Both together make processes scalable and reliable.
- Tools like Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, and Kubernetes highlight the differences.

Would you like me to also create a **general template** for service notes so you can reuse it across all your labs (CloudFormation, Automation, Hello World, etc.) to keep your GitHub repo consistent?
