# **Mokgadi Selepe – About Me**

Hi! My name is Mokgadi Selepe and welcome to my GitHub profile.

## AWS re/Start Journey
I started the **AWS re/Start Cloud Computing Programme** on **06 October 2025** and I will finish on **26 December 2025**.  
Every day I learn something new about the cloud and I am enjoying the journey a lot.  
My big goal is to write and pass the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam early in 2026.

Right now I am busy with hands-on labs in:
- Cloud Foundations
- Linux basics
- Networking
- Security & IAM
- Python programming
- Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)
- Servers and compute (EC2, Lambda)

## My Technology Skills & Certificates
