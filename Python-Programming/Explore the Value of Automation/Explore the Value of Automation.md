# **Explore the Value of Automation**

## What Happened
I was given a lab exercise about automation in software development. The lab had two main parts:
1. *Research:* In groups, pick one topic (Build Automation, Test Automation, or Deployment Automation) and answer specific questions.
2. *Presentation:* Share your findings with the class in a short 2–3 minute presentation.

The questions for each topic were about:
- Tools used
- Benefits
- Challenges/problems

Finally, there was a class discussion about the value of automation and why not everything should be automated.

### Topic 1: Build Automation
- *What is it?*  
  Automatically compiles code after changes are made.
- *Tools:*  
  Maven, Gradle, Jenkins, Apache Ant.
- *Benefits:*  
  Saves time by reducing manual work, ensures consistent builds, speeds up development and delivery.
- *Challenges:*  
  Initial setup can be complex, requires proper configuration, can fail if dependencies are not managed well.

### Topic 2: Test Automation
- *What is it?*  
  Uses scripts and tools to test software automatically after changes.
- *Tools:*  
  Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Cypress.
- *Benefits:*  
  Faster testing compared to manual testing, improves accuracy and reduces human error, supports continuous integration.
- *Challenges:*  
  High upfront cost for tools and setup, maintenance of test scripts is time-consuming, not all tests can be automated (e.g., UI/UX).

### Topic 3: Deployment Automation
- *What is it?*  
  Automates the process of moving code to a usable format for testing or production.
- *Tools:*  
  Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes.
- *Benefits:*  
  Reduces deployment errors, speeds up release cycles, makes rollback easier if something goes wrong.
- *Challenges:*  
  Requires skilled team members, complex for large systems, security risks if not configured properly.

### Lab Review Questions
- *What is the value of automation?*  
  Saves time, reduces errors, improves consistency, and speeds up delivery.
- *Why not automate everything?*  
  Some tasks need human judgment, automation can be expensive and complex, and over-automation can lead to unnecessary maintenance.
