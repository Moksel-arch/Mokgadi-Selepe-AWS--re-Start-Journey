# **Mokgadi Selepe – About Me**

Hi! My name is Mokgadi Selepe and welcome to my GitHub profile.

## AWS re/Start Journey

I started the **AWS re/Start Cloud Computing Programme** on **06 October 2025** and I will finish on **26 December 2025**.  
Every day I learn something new about the cloud and I am enjoying the journey a lot.  
My big goal is to know more about this Cloud journey and later become a **Solutions Architect**.

Right now I am busy with hands-on labs in:

*   Cloud Foundations
*   Linux basics
*   Networking
*   Security & IAM
*   Python programming
*   Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)
*   Servers and compute (EC2, Lambda)

## Why Cloud Computing Excites Me

Cloud computing is transforming the way businesses and individuals build, deploy, and scale applications. What fascinates me most is how the cloud brings **flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency** to technology solutions. With services like **AWS**, you can launch servers in minutes, store data securely, and integrate advanced tools like AI and machine learning—all without managing physical infrastructure.

For me, the cloud represents **innovation and opportunity**. It’s not just about hosting applications; it’s about enabling creativity, solving real-world problems, and making technology accessible to everyone. My goal is to master these concepts and eventually become an **AWS Solutions Architect**, helping organizations design secure, reliable, and scalable systems.

## My Technology Skills & Certificates

Before AWS re/Start I spent a lot of time learning programming and data science. Here is what I have completed so far:

### Full Stack & Web Development

*   Full Stack Development Certificate (FNB App Academy – 32 credits, July 2025)
*   HTML & CSS (multiple projects: Netflix clone, Tesla landing page, virtual business cards)
*   Introduction to Python Programming
*   Object-Oriented Programming with Python

### Data Science & Analytics

*   Data Science Programme Certificate (Zaio – September 2025)
*   Introduction to Data Science
*   Exploratory Data Analysis
*   Statistical Techniques for Data Science
*   SQL – A Practical Guide (completed several times)
*   Machine Learning basics

### Artificial Intelligence

*   AI Practitioner Learning Plan (Zaio – August 2025)
*   Generative AI for Decision Makers (Zaio – August 2025)

### Other Skills

*   Digital Literacy
*   GitHub and basic Git commands
*   Problem-solving and learning how to learn

## What’s Next for Me?

*   Finish AWS re/Start strong (December 2025)
*   Pass AWS Cloud Practitioner exam (early 2026)
*   Start preparing for AWS Solutions Architect – Associate
*   Keep building small projects and adding them here

I love learning new things in tech and I am always happy to connect with others who are also on their cloud or coding journey.
