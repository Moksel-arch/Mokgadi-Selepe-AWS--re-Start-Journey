In this lab I’m going to walk through the basics of working with an Amazon EC2 instance – from launching it, to resizing, managing, and finally monitoring its performance.

Amazon EC2 is essentially a cloud‑based computer that you can spin up on demand. Because it’s part of AWS, you get a simple web interface that lets you grab a new server in just a few clicks, scale it up or down as your needs change, and only pay for the compute time you actually use.

Here’s what the lab covers, in plain English:

- Launch an instance – I pick an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), choose the instance type, and fire it up.
- Resize the instance – I can change the instance size (CPU, memory, etc.) while it’s running or stop it and resize it later.
- Manage the instance – I start, stop, reboot, or terminate the server, and attach or detach storage as needed.
- Monitor the instance – I use CloudWatch to keep an eye on CPU usage, network traffic, and other metrics, so I know if something’s going wrong.

By the end of the lab I’ll have a solid feel for how EC2 lets you get compute resources quickly, scale them flexibly, and keep everything running smoothly without having to buy physical hardware.
