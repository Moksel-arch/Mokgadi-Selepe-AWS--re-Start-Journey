# AWS re/Start Database Labs Portfolio

**Author:** Mokgadi Selepe  
**Date:** November 26, 2025  

---

## 📖 Overview
This portfolio summarizes hands-on experiences from multiple AWS re/Start labs focused on databases.  

Key themes:
- **Relational database management** with Amazon RDS and Aurora  
- **SQL query fundamentals** and advanced operations on the sample *world* database (countries, cities, languages)  
- **NoSQL operations** with Amazon DynamoDB  

This demonstrates practical skills in database setup, querying, and management for cloud applications.

## 🧩 Lab 1: Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB Using an App (Amazon RDS)

**Objective:** Launch an RDS DB instance, configure connections from a web server, and test interactions via a web app.

### Steps
1. **Create Security Group for RDS**  
   - Allowed MySQL/Aurora (port 3306) from Web Security Group  

2. **Create DB Subnet Group**  
   - Selected two private subnets in different AZs for high availability  

3. **Create Amazon RDS DB Instance**  
   - Engine: MySQL  
   - Instance class: `db.t3.medium`  
   - Storage: GP SSD  
   - Deployment: Multi-AZ  
   - Database: `world`  

4. **Interact via Web App**  
   - Configured app with RDS endpoint, username, password  
   - Tested CRUD operations  

### Key Learnings
- RDS handles management, enabling focus on apps  
- Multi-AZ ensures availability  
- Security groups control access

## 🧩 Lab 2: Database Table Operations

**Objective:** Perform common operations like creating, showing, altering, and dropping databases/tables using SQL.

### Key SQL Commands
```sql
CREATE DATABASE world;

CREATE TABLE world.country (
  Code CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  Name CHAR(52) NOT NULL,
  Continent ENUM('Asia','Europe','North America','Africa','Oceania','Antarctica','South America') NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (Code)
);

ALTER TABLE world.country CHANGE Conitinent Continent ENUM('Asia','Europe', ...) NOT NULL;

DROP TABLE world.country;
DROP DATABASE world;
```

### Key Learnings
- `CREATE` for new DB/tables  
- `SHOW` to view  
- `ALTER` to modify  
- `DROP` to delete  

---

## 🧩 Lab 3: Inserting Data into a Database

**Objective:** Insert, update, delete data in tables; import from SQL file.

### Key SQL Commands
```sql
INSERT INTO world.country VALUES ('IRL', 'Ireland', 'Europe', ...);
UPDATE world.country SET Population = 100, SurfaceArea = 100;
DELETE FROM world.country;
mysql -u root -p < world.sql
```

### Key Learnings
- `INSERT` adds rows  
- `UPDATE` modifies rows  
- `DELETE` removes rows  
- Import SQL files for bulk data  

---

## 🧩 Lab 4: Introduction to Amazon Aurora

**Objective:** Create Aurora DB instance, connect from EC2, create tables, insert/query data.

### Key SQL Commands
```sql
CREATE TABLE country (
  Code CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  Name CHAR(52) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO country VALUES ('AUS', 'Australia', 'Oceania', ...);

SELECT * FROM country WHERE GNP > 35000 AND Population > 10000000;
```

### Key Learnings
- Aurora is high-performance, MySQL-compatible  
- Connect from EC2 using MySQL client and endpoint  

---

## 🧩 Lab 5: Introduction to Amazon DynamoDB

**Objective:** Create NoSQL table, add/modify items, query/scan, delete table.

### Operations
- **Create Table:** `Music` with partition key `Artist`, sort key `Song`  
- **Add Items:** Pink Floyd – Money, John Lennon – Imagine, Psy – Gangnam Style  
- **Modify Item:** Updated Psy’s release year  
- **Query/Scan:** Query by keys, scan by filters  
- **Delete Table**  

### Key Learnings
- DynamoDB is schema-less and flexible  
- Partition/sort keys enable efficient queries  
- Query vs Scan for lookups  

---

## 🧩 Lab 6: Organizing Data (GROUP BY & OVER)

```sql
SELECT Region, SUM(Population) AS TotalPopulation FROM country GROUP BY Region;

SELECT Name, Population,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY Population DESC) AS Rank
FROM country;
```

**Learnings:**  
- `GROUP BY` for aggregations  
- `OVER` for window functions (running totals, ranks)  

---

## 🧩 Lab 7: Conditional Search

```sql
SELECT * FROM country WHERE Population BETWEEN 50000000 AND 100000000;
SELECT * FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Europe';
SELECT SUM(Population) AS TotalPopulation FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Europe';
```

**Learnings:**  
- `WHERE` filters rows  
- `BETWEEN` for ranges  
- `LIKE` for patterns  

---

## 🧩 Lab 8: Selecting Data

```sql
SELECT Name, SurfaceArea AS 'Surface Area' FROM country;
SELECT * FROM country ORDER BY Population DESC;
SELECT * FROM country WHERE Population > 50000000 AND Continent = 'Europe';
```

**Learnings:**  
- `SELECT` retrieves data  
- `AS` for aliases  
- `ORDER BY` for sorting  

---

## 🧩 Lab 9: Working with Functions

```sql
SELECT SUM(Population), AVG(Population), MAX(Population), MIN(Population), COUNT(*) FROM country;

SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(Region, '/', 1) AS 'Region Name 1',
       SUBSTRING_INDEX(Region, '/', -1) AS 'Region Name 2'
FROM country WHERE Region = 'Micronesia/Caribbean';

SELECT DISTINCT Region FROM country;
```

**Learnings:**  
- Aggregates: `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT`  
- String functions: `SUBSTRING_INDEX`, `LENGTH`, `TRIM`  
- `DISTINCT` removes duplicates
