# @MALLS - Africa's Finest Roots  
### A Group Project: Moving a Traditional South African Restaurant Online with AWS  

This was a group AWS-re-Star-programme-project on November 2025 Cohort with Praesignis, where five of us built a modern, low-cost online presence for a fictional (but very realistic) South African restaurant – @MALLS. We took a real-world problem many small restaurants still face in 2025 (paper bookings, WhatsApp orders, no customer database) and fixed it using a static website on AWS S3 with a bunch of serverless services for the dynamic parts.

Live site: [My static site](https://static-website-on-s3.netlify.app) 

## The Team  
We worked together and each had our own focus area:  
- **Mokgadi M.** – Web Development  
- **Skhumbuzo S.** – Web Development  
- **Aytee A.** – Research & Documentation  
- **Lethabo L.** – AWS S3 Deployment + Infrastructure  
- **Leah L.** – Presentation & Design  

Proudly South African – hence all the orange and the flag vibes :)

## The Problem (Real Restaurant Struggles)  
Before we touched anything, the restaurant was running completely manually:  
- Order mix-ups and wrong dishes all the time  
- Double-bookings → angry customers waiting for tables  
- No central customer database → repeat customers treated like strangers  
- Staff shortages making everything worse  

They were spending over R6 000 a month just on phone bills, printed menus, and lost business.

## Our Solution  
A fast, good-looking static website hosted on AWS S3 with these features:  
- Gallery of delicious dishes  
- Dine-in reservation form  
- Take-away / delivery order form  
- Simple loyalty program (earn points, redeem meals)  
- User registration & login  
- Interactive map with directions  
- Contact info and opening hours  

Even though the front-end is static, everything that needs to be dynamic (forms, logins, storing bookings/orders) is handled by serverless AWS services – no servers to manage!

## Tech Stack / AWS Services We Used  
| Service              | What it does                                  |  
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| S3                   | Hosts the static website and all images       |  
| CloudFront           | CDN – makes the site load crazy fast worldwide |  
| Route 53             | DNS and our custom domain                     |  
| Certificate Manager  | Free SSL (https)                              |  
| API Gateway          | Receives form submissions                     |  
| Lambda               | Backend logic for bookings, orders, loyalty   |  
| DynamoDB             | Stores reservations, orders, loyalty points   |  
| Cognito              | User sign-up / sign-in                        |  
| Amazon Location Service | Interactive map on the contact page        |  

## Cost – This Blew Our Minds  
After everything was live, the total monthly AWS bill came to **R540 – R630**.  
Compared to the old manual system that was indirectly costing them **+R6 000/month**, that’s a no-brainer.

Breakdown (approximate):  
- CloudFront: ~R470 (the biggest chunk)  
- DynamoDB: ~R48  
- Route 53: R16  
- Lambda, API Gateway, S3: just a couple of rands each  
- Cognito, ACM, Location Service: Free tier  

## What We Learned  
- You can build a fully functional “dynamic” site without ever touching a traditional server  
- Serverless is insanely cheap for small-to-medium traffic  
- Deploying updates takes minutes, not days  
- Security, backups, and scaling are basically handled for you  
- Small businesses in SA can compete with the big guys if they move to the cloud  

## How to Run Locally  
If you clone this repo and just want to see the front-end:  
```bash
# open index.html in your browser – that’s literally it
# or use a local server if you prefer
npx serve .
```

The backend (Lambda functions, API Gateway, etc.) is not in this repo because we deployed it separately via the AWS console / SAM for the project demo.

## Final Thoughts  
This project started as a simple “deploy a static site to S3” assignment and ended up becoming a full cloud migration case study. We’re really proud of what the five of us managed to pull together in a short time, and honestly, any real restaurant could copy this setup tomorrow and save thousands every month.

Feel free to fork, steal ideas, or hit us up if you want help doing something similar for your own business!
